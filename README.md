# VSkillUp

## Description
The project aims to revolutionize the learning experience by eliminating traditional multiple-choice questions and introducing a text-based learning system. The system utilizes cutting-edge machine learning techniques to assess user responses accurately and provide feedback on their understanding.

The project consists of three key features:

## Play/Learn: 
Users are presented with a word and are required to provide a text-based answer, expressing their understanding of the word. The ML model powered by the Universal Sentence Encoder compares the user's response with the correct answer, providing an accuracy score in percentage.

## Daily Challenge: 
A daily challenge feature presents users with a single word, encouraging them to answer and maintain a streak of consecutive correct responses. This feature promotes regular engagement and a continuous learning experience.

## Play with Friends: 
Users can create and join rooms to play and learn together. The organizer throws words, and participants submit their answers. The real-time chat feature enables users to communicate and collaborate with each other while playing, fostering a dynamic and interactive learning environment.
